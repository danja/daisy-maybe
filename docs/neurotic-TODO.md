# Neurotic TODO

## Menu layout

the OUT menu item should be removed, with the output level always set to maximum

## Algorithms

### Braid

This doesn't seem to do anything apart from produce a slightly buzzy version of the input. The controls don't appear to have any effect. Review algothithm.

## Binaural

The effects should be a bit more pronounced

## Formant

Noise/air injection is on the ARTIC control, the control labeled BREATH doesn't appear to do anything
Noise injection level should default to zero

## Harmonic

Output level is very low compared to other algorithms, and with some crunchy distortion.

## PhaseLoom

Knobs/CV controls have no effect. Its not clear what this is meant to be doing.

## MicroGran

CV 2 introduces a lot of white noise
