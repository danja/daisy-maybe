# Neurotic TODO

## General

Menu items should use capitalised short names where possible, eg. LRATE -> Rate, POLES -> Poles

Common Controls :

* Mix 
* FB
* Mod (rename LDEPTH)
* Rate (rename LRATE)

All as a percentage except Rate, which should be expressed as 2 digit decimal Hz

LFO depth doesn't currently zero correctly.

## Algorithms

### Braid

This doesn't seem to do anything apart from produce a slightly buzzy version of the input. The controls don't appear to have any effect. Review algothithm

## Formant

Noise/air injection is on the ARTIC control, the control labeled BREATH doesn't appear to do anything
Noise injection level should default to zero

## Harmonic

Output level is very low compared to other algorithms, and with some crunchy distortion.

## PhaseLoom

Knobs/CV controls have no effect. Its not clear what this is meant to be doing.
