# Menu System

Rotary controller with switch.

Each menu page contains a list of items, each on a row. Pressing the switch moves to the next item, returning to the first item after clicking on the last. The behaviour on moving the rotary controller is determined by the currently selected item. The currently selected item is indicated by an asterisk to the left of the line.
If there are more items in the list than available lines, they will remain hidden until selection, which will cause the list to scroll up.

Most items will be parameters with a variable value that can be changed by rotating the encoder. But the top, title, line of a menu page when selected, gives access to other menu pages by rotating the controller. Clicking the switch when in that position allows paging. Clicking the title line on the last page cycles back to the first page.
