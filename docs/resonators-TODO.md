# Resonators TODO

## Menu Changes

The menus will be changed to the following:

### Wiring 

Was Master, but RMIX and DMIX will be moved elsewhere.

* X-X (was FXX)
* Y-Y (was FYY)
* X-Y (was FXY)
* Y-X (was FYX)

### Resonate

was Res, DMX and DMY will be removed

* Ratio (was RAT, ratio of delay lengths)
* Mix (was RMIX, wet/dry of resonator output)

### Distort

was Dist

* Fold (mix of fold subsystem, wet/dry)
* Drive (mix of overdrive subsystem, wet/dry)
* NFold (was FOLD, number of wavefoldings)

### Filter

New menu.

Damping replaced by a 2-pole low pass filter on each delay line. The frequency control will be determined from the same sources as the delay line lengths, related to pitch as a ratio.

* Level 
* Freq (ratio, 0.25-2)
* Q (0.5-2)
