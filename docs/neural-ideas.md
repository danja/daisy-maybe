# Neural Synthesis & Processing Ideas

These concepts assume **four control inputs (C1–C4)**, **two audio inputs (A1–A2)**, and **two audio outputs (O1–O2)**. Each idea treats the four controls as continuous parameters (0.0–1.0) unless otherwise noted.

## 1) Neural Cross-Resonator (NCR)
A hybrid resonator that learns to map input excitation into a controllable “virtual body” response. It behaves like a cross between convolution reverb and physical modeling, but the impulse response is generated by a compact neural network conditioned by controls.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → feature encoder → neural resonator core → stereo decoder → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Mass)**: shifts modal density and low-end emphasis (bigger body vs. tighter formant).
  - **C2 (Tension)**: shifts resonant frequencies upward/downward.
  - **C3 (Damping)**: changes decay time and high-frequency absorption.
  - **C4 (Asymmetry)**: introduces left/right dispersion differences (stereo spread and phase skew).
- **Use case**: Turn simple inputs (pluck, noise, voice) into physically plausible “instruments” with a single model.

## 2) Latent Spectral Braider (LSB)
A neural spectral processor that weaves A1 and A2 into a shared latent spectral “braid.” It can morph, interleave, and reassign partials between sources while preserving transients.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → multires STFT → latent braid net → resynthesis → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Braid Depth)**: amount of partial exchange between A1 and A2.
  - **C2 (Formant Swap)**: pulls spectral envelopes from A2 onto A1 (or vice-versa).
  - **C3 (Transient Lock)**: protects attacks; low = smeary, high = crisp.
  - **C4 (Stereo Weave)**: routes low/high partials to L/R with learned spatial cues.
- **Use case**: Intelligent cross-synthesis that keeps timing intact while remixing spectral identity.

## 3) Neural Tape Hydraulics (NTH)
A learned nonlinearity + modulation model that emulates tape echo, springy instability, and fluid compression as a single controllable block. The network predicts time-varying delay, saturation, and micro-flutter based on the inputs and controls.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → temporal encoder → neural delay/sat core → stereo out → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Drive)**: saturation intensity and bias.
  - **C2 (Flow)**: amount of time-warping (flutter, wow, slosh).
  - **C3 (Head Gap)**: high-frequency loss + smear width.
  - **C4 (Feedback)**: internal regeneration with learned stability control.
- **Use case**: One knob-able block for unstable, characterful delay without runaway artifacts.

## 4) Binaural Gesture Mapper (BGM)
A neural spatializer that learns to map gesture-like control motion into psychoacoustic movement. Uses a compact HRTF-conditioned net to place and animate sources in a dynamic 3D field.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → spatial feature encoder → HRTF net → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Azimuth)**: left-right orbit.
  - **C2 (Elevation)**: top/bottom placement.
  - **C3 (Distance)**: near/far with learned air absorption.
  - **C4 (Spin)**: adds rotational Doppler + interaural phase motion.
- **Use case**: Expressive binaural motion that feels like “playing” space.

## 5) Neural Formant Forge (NFF)
A two-source vocal/instrument shaper that learns to impose a time-varying formant lattice on both inputs, with controllable “phoneme gravity.”

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → phoneme encoder → formant lattice net → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Vowel Pull)**: locks energy toward vowel-like resonances.
  - **C2 (Articulation)**: smooth ↔ percussive formant movement.
  - **C3 (Breathiness)**: injects noisy components and aspirate texture.
  - **C4 (Split)**: separate formant tracks per channel (dual-voice effect).
- **Use case**: Turn any input into a voice-like or reed-like sound with expressive morphing.

## 6) Neural Diffusion Multiband (NDM)
A neural multiband processor that diffuses spectral energy in time and frequency, like a smart reverb/chorus hybrid. The network predicts bandwise diffusion kernels.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → multiband analysis → diffusion net → recombine → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Spread)**: how far energy smears across time.
  - **C2 (Color)**: tilt and band emphasis.
  - **C3 (Granularity)**: coarse vs. fine diffusion texture.
  - **C4 (Stereo Drift)**: independent diffusion for L/R with correlation control.
- **Use case**: Fast “liquid” ambience that doesn’t wash out transients.

## 7) Neural Energy Shaper (NES)
A learned dynamics processor that treats energy distribution as a first-class feature, reshaping perceived loudness and punch. It can simultaneously compress A1 while expanding A2, then recombine them into a stereo output.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → energy encoder → dual dynamics net → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Punch)**: transient emphasis vs. smoothness.
  - **C2 (Glue)**: cross-input linking; higher means shared dynamics.
  - **C3 (Lift)**: spectral upward expansion (presence).
  - **C4 (Bias)**: choose which input dominates the final energy map.
- **Use case**: Intelligent bus-style dynamics with expressive cross-source coupling.

## 8) Neural Harmonic Cartographer (NHC)
A harmonic remapper that reprojects partials into a learned “harmonic map,” allowing for inharmonic or stretched harmonic series with smooth control.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → harmonic analysis → remap net → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Stretch)**: harmonic spacing factor.
  - **C2 (Inharmonicity)**: bends partials off the harmonic grid.
  - **C3 (Sparsity)**: selects dominant partials vs. dense spectra.
  - **C4 (Mirror)**: folds upper partials into lower bands (octave folds).
- **Use case**: Morph from realistic harmonics to metallic/alien spectra without losing pitch.

## 9) Neural Phase Loom (NPL)
A phase-focused processor that reconstructs phase relationships between A1 and A2, enabling controllable “phase synthesis” while keeping magnitude stable.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → complex STFT → phase net → inverse STFT → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Phase Bind)**: lock phases between A1 and A2.
  - **C2 (Swirl)**: introduce nonlinear phase warping.
  - **C3 (Tilt)**: low/high phase skew.
  - **C4 (Stereo Phase)**: widen/narrow by inter-channel phase shaping.
- **Use case**: Spatial widening, comb-free chorus, or “gelled” dual-source texture.

## 10) Neural Micro-Granulator (NMG)
A learned granulation engine that predicts grain size, overlap, and pitch shift based on input content and controls, with smooth transitions and minimal artifacts.

- **Signal flow**: A1/A2 → grain analysis → grain net → grain mixer → O1/O2
- **Controls**:
  - **C1 (Grain Size)**: tiny shimmer ↔ long smear.
  - **C2 (Drift)**: randomized pitch and timing variations.
  - **C3 (Blend)**: original vs. granulated balance (learned crossfade).
  - **C4 (Stereo Scatter)**: spatial dispersion of grains.
- **Use case**: Musical granular textures that self-tune to the source.

## Optional Shared Implementation Notes
- All models can be **lightweight** (tens of thousands of params) using 1D convs + GRU blocks or small transformers.
- Use **latent conditioning**: concatenate controls to intermediate embeddings and modulate via FiLM or AdaIN.
- If running in real-time, use block-based inference (128–512 samples) and optional **lookahead** for transient protection.
- For safety and stability, clamp outputs and add a learnable “bypass” mixture to avoid runaway feedback.
